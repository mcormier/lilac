-- Lilac --
An Experiment with Core Foundation, Objective-C and Windows

This project creates a Windows .EXE that opens a .webloc file.
A .webloc file is generally a binary plist.
Lilac finds the URL property and then opens the URL in the 
default browser.

The project was created to start a process of becoming
comfortable building software with Objective-C on the
Windows platform. 

To build this project you must use cygwin.
